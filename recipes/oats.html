        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This recipe will teach you how to make a basic overnight 
            oats recipe for beginners</p>
        
            <p>If you’ve never had overnight oatmeal, 
            they’re basically a no-cook method of making oatmeal. 
            So, instead of cooking oatmeal on the stovetop or in 
            the microwave, you soak the raw oats with milk. 
            That soaking process allows the oats to absorb the
             liquid and soften them enough to eat uncooked. 
             You only need to let the oats soak and rest in the 
             fridge for 2 hours. But, it’s ideal if you soak it 
             overnight…hence the name overnight oats!</p>
        
             <p>The next morning you have a ready-to-eat, delicious, 
            creamy bowl or jar of “oatmeal.” The consistency is 
            like a porridge or pudding. It makes for an easy 
            convenient breakfast that has a more dense and creamy 
            texture than warm oatmeal.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
